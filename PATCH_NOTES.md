# KM2 Image Studio – Patch Notes

## v1.3.0
- Added a File/Help menu bar with quick access to the workflow guide and the update checker.
- New Help → Check for Updates… flow compares your version with GitHub, previews the changes, and offers to install them.
- Successful updates now save their notes to `patch_notes/` so you always know what changed.
- Updated the double-click launcher so it only reminds you about optional packages like `rembg` instead of reinstalling them each launch.
