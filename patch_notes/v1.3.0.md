# KM2 Image Studio v1.3.0

## What's new
- Added a classic File/Help menu bar so the app feels familiar on every desktop.
- Introduced Help → Check for Updates… to look online for new versions, preview the patch notes, and kick off the installer for you.
- Each update now drops its patch notes into the `patch_notes/` folder so you can review changes later.
- Tweaked the double-click launcher so it no longer blocks on installing `rembg`; you will only see a friendly reminder when optional extras are missing.
